class TanhTransform(Transform):
    r"""
    Transform via the mapping :math:`y = \tanh(x)`.
    It is equivalent to
    ```
    ComposeTransform([AffineTransform(0., 2.), SigmoidTransform(), AffineTransform(-1., 2.)])
    ```
    However this might not be numerically stable, thus it is recommended to use `TanhTransform`
    instead.
    Note that one should use `cache_size=1` when it comes to `NaN/Inf` values.
